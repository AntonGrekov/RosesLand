Uploading in 29/06/2020 but done in late 2018

A more advanced Pug/JS/SCSS project. Right now, I am finding myself a very beginning developer, even though, looking at this project's code 
i want to say - "how young and innocent we were :)". In this project i for learing reasons decided to create internet shop functionallity 
from zero. You can find this in **mini-cart.js** file. I decided not to fix some bad code parts for history. It actually works and look still quite good to me :)
It adds/removes and displays items in cart in a minicart block if you move cursor to a cart icon. 

# Features in this project:
*Swiper in a slider role*

*Pure JS/jQuery code, functions, to add/remove/display cart items*

*Pug/SCSS markup, separate files, clear code*

*Scrolling animation per screens made on JS by myself, without plugins*

*Price prettier function to show prices in a better way*
